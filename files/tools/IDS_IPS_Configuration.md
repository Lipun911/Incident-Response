# IDS/IPS Configuration

## Introduction

This document provides guidelines for configuring Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to enhance network security and prevent DDoS attacks.

## IDS/IPS Rules

1. **Filter ICMP Traffic**
   - Create rules to filter ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.

2. **Detect Anomalies**
   - Configure IDS/IPS to detect anomalies in network traffic.

3. **Alerting**
   - Set up alerts for detected anomalies and potential security incidents.

## Configuration Steps

1. **Access the IDS/IPS Management Console**
   - Login to the IDS/IPS management console using administrative credentials.

2. **Create New Rules**
   - Navigate to the rules section.
   - Create new rules to filter ICMP traffic and detect anomalies.

3. **Set Up Alerts**
   - Configure alerting settings to receive notifications for detected anomalies and potential security incidents.

## Testing and Verification

1. **Test the IDS/IPS Rules**
   - Conduct tests to ensure that the new IDS/IPS rules are working as expected.

2. **Monitor Network Traffic**
   - Continuously monitor network traffic for any signs of abnormal activity or potential attacks.
