# Network Monitoring

## Introduction

This document provides guidelines for implementing network monitoring to detect abnormal traffic patterns and potential security incidents.

## Monitoring Tools

1. **Network Monitoring Software**
   - Implement network monitoring software to continuously monitor network traffic and detect anomalies.

2. **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**
   - Use IDS/IPS to detect and prevent potential security incidents.

## Configuration Steps

1. **Install Network Monitoring Software**
   - Install the chosen network monitoring software on the network.

2. **Configure Monitoring Settings**
   - Configure the monitoring settings to establish a baseline of normal network behavior.
   - Set up alerts for abnormal traffic patterns.

3. **Integrate IDS/IPS**
   - Integrate IDS/IPS with the network monitoring software to enhance detection capabilities.

## Testing and Verification

1. **Test the Monitoring Tools**
   - Conduct tests to ensure that the monitoring tools are working as expected.

2. **Monitor Network Traffic**
   - Continuously monitor network traffic for any signs of abnormal activity or potential attacks.
