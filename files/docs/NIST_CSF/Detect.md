# Detect

## Objective

Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.

## Steps

1. **Anomalies and Events**
   - Establish a baseline of normal network behavior.
   - Monitor for anomalies and suspicious events.

2. **Security Continuous Monitoring**

3. **Detection Processes**
   - Develop and maintain incident detection processes and procedures.
   - Regularly review and update detection processes.
