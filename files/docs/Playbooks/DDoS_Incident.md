# DDoS Incident Response Playbook

## Introduction

This playbook outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

## Objectives

- Mitigate the impact of the DDoS attack
- Restore normal network operations
- Implement measures to prevent future attacks

## Incident Response Steps

1. **Detection**
   - Monitor network traffic for signs of a DDoS attack (e.g., a flood of ICMP packets).

2. **Containment**
   - Block incoming ICMP packets at the firewall.
   - Take non-critical network services offline.
   - Restore critical network services.

3. **Eradication**
   - Identify the source of the attack (e.g., unconfigured firewall).
   - Implement a new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets.
   - Verify source IP addresses on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses.

4. **Recovery**
   - Restore all network services.
   - Monitor the network for any signs of residual attack activity.

5. **Lessons Learned**
   - Conduct a post-incident review.
   - Update the Incident Response Plan and Playbook as needed.
